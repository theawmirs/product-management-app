# Product Management Application

Welcome to the **Product Management Application**! This web-based project allows users to add, edit, and delete products dynamically, with persistent data storage using `localStorage`.

> I came across a similar project on YouTube that was built using React. Since I haven’t learned React yet, I decided to challenge myself by building it entirely with Vanilla JavaScript.


## Features

- **Add Products:** Create new products with a name, image URL, and price.
- **Edit Products:** Modify existing product details.
- **Delete Products:** Remove products from the list.
- **Persistent Storage:** Uses `localStorage` to save products, ensuring data is retained even after page reloads.
- **Interactive UI:** Provides real-time feedback with success/error messages for user actions.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Markup structure.
- **CSS3**: Styling for a responsive and visually appealing UI.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality, including:
  - DOM manipulation
  - Event handling
  - `localStorage` for data persistence
